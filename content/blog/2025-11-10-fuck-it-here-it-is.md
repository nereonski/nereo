2025-11-10 — Fuck it. Here it is.

Again, I found myself wasting time because I wasn't feeling good about the design, the text, or whatever.

Then I realized — fuck it! I'll just share the website as it is.

That's what this was all about in the first place: having a personal website where I can do whatever I want.

And yet, I got stuck again.

But realizing this felt good somehow.

So here it is — my very first website, my very first blog note.
