# Nereo Portfolio Website

This is my personal website to **learn, test, and showcase** my work.
It’s where I experiment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub workflows.
Of course, I am cheating a lot by vibecoding most of the design and stuff. But the content is mine.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Main website file  
- `style.css` – Styling and layout  
- `script.js` – JavaScript functions  
- `/assets` – Images and icons  

## Next Steps
1. Create a repository on GitHub (private or public)  
2. Upload these files or push them via Git  
3. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repository settings  
4. Access your live site at  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/nereo-portfolio`
